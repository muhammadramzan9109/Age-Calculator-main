# Age Calculator Website

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Today, I'm excited to share a project I recently completed: an **Age Calculator**. This project allows users to calculate their exact age based on their date of birth, providing the result in a clear and user-friendly interface. It's a great way to practice working with JavaScript, particularly with date and time functions, while building something practical.

## Project Overview

The **Age Calculator** is designed to give users an easy way to find out their current age in years, months, and days. Users simply enter their date of birth, and with the click of a button, their age is displayed. This project is perfect for developers who want to improve their skills in handling dates and building interactive web applications.

## Features

- **Date Input**: Users can enter their date of birth using a date picker for accurate input.
- **Age Calculation**: The application calculates the user's exact age, down to the number of days.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works smoothly on different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content on the webpage.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the webpage and ensuring it is responsive across various devices.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for handling the age calculation logic and updating the DOM.
